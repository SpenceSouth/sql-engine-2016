## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to modify code that was inherited from a previous semester of Data Modeling to fix their bugs and add data warehouse functionality.

## Goals

Refactor the backend component to use a more appropriate data storage format that is more suitable for building upon, such as XML or JSON.
Minimize the number of global, static, and unnamed temporary variables used by the previous team.
Expand the SQL Engine to appropriately handle multiple databases
