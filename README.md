## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to modify code that was inherited from a previous semester of Data Modeling to fix their bugs and add data warehouse functionality.

## Goals

Refactor the backend component to use a more appropriate data storage format that is more suitable for building upon, such as XML or JSON.
Minimize the number of global, static, and unnamed temporary variables used by the previous team.
Expand the SQL Engine to appropriately handle multiple databases

## Unit Tests

To use the unit test script you need to configure your IDE to create a 
jar file of the project on Make. In IntelliJ you can do this by going to
 Project Structure -> Artifacts -> + -> JAR -> From modules with dependencies
 -> change the export path to the root of the project.
 
 Then just run the python script from the terminal with:
 python UnitTests.py
